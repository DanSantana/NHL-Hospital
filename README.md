1 Introduction

The present project aims to demonstrate the skills and knowledge acquired until the present moment in the CDI College, programmer analyst / Internet solutions developer - LEA.9c.
Simulating a real world situation the project highlight the first work day in the consulting firm, as junior programmer.
The main task received consists in a development of a new prototype application that simulates the operation of an automatic Teller Machine.
 Applying a graphical interface and also allowing the practice of a lot of items already used and previous studied the main objective are listed below:
•	Interpret specification and analysis performed;
•	Design a solution based on the requirements and specification;
•	Design the logic required for and event-driven solution;
•	Translate design documents and algorithms into source code;
•	Read from and write to a file;
•	Use debugging tools, and error-handling techniques;
•	Validate the solution with test data;
•	Integrate the knowledge’s acquired thus far;
•	Have fun while programming with visual studio C#.net

 

2. Project Description
As a junior Software Developer working for a small software solutions firm, CDISoft. In the first few months, the firm gave you several small prototype projects to assess your abilities. Your work has been outstanding, and CDISoft is now ready to entrust an application to your care. 
NorthernLights Hospital is a small health care facility located in northern Canada. Due to lack of money, they have had to make do with outdated paper and DOS-like programs to track patients. Although the employees are very familiar with the old system, and rarely make mistakes (or know how to fix them if they do), NLH feels its time to update the system. The hospital board was very impressed with the proposal to design, develop and maintain the patient tracking system put forward by the senior developer and awarded the contract to CDISoft.  
When putting together the proposal, the senior developer was mindful that a patient tracking system is only the first step in a future major scale application. Normally, a smaller scale application such as that required by NLH would most likely be 2-tier using an Access database. However, if designed as an n-tier solution using SQL Server for scalability, it would be possible to easily modify and expand it with minimal disruption to staff plus the application could be sold and modified to suit other health care facilities. NLH is agreeable to such an arrangement because CDISoft intends to absorb the additional investment costs with a view to recouping them later.  
Initially, Kent Tellme, a coworker, was assigned to work with the senior developer. Unfortunately, just before starting development, the senior developer suddenly took ill due to a stroke and is unable to work for the next several months. Kent Tellme was promoted to intermediate developer responsible the NLH project. Within days, Kent suddenly left CDISoft for another job. That meant the development would need to be entrusted to a contract worker or to one of CDISoft’s three junior developers. CDISoft has chosen you to complete what Kent started while they search for replacements for the senior and intermediate developers. Of course, you want a promotion to intermediate developer, so you are willing to do whatever it takes to develop the business solution that NLH and its employees require. You are aware you will need to quickly learn techniques that you may not be familiar with yet. 
The proposed Role: CDISoft wants to use whatever Kent Tellme has already developed. Kent always had a bad habit of not documenting his work so you will need to carefully review it. You need to familiarize yourself with the business rules, decipher and apply what Kent has completed, and finish building the final release of the patient admission system for NLH.  
OBJECTIVES The objectives of this project are: 
• Design, adapt and document an n-tier application 
• Design, adapt and build a SQL Server database 
• Design, adapt and build a user-centric interface 
• Build an n-tier application 
• Debug and handle errors to produce an error-free applicant

6.	Conclusion

Through the integration project, it was possible to practice important learning acquired until the present moment. Also, engage the theory building a programming application closer to the real world with visual Studio and C Sharp console application in additional with programming and logical design, programming fundamentals, system analysis design.
Overall, the utilization of Programming Object Oriented, in addition to better organize the software structure, provides a better reading of them in the self-niche, minimize errors while improving the quality and the speed in debug the software.
The system.io stream reader provides a powerful feature in order to keep some information in the system, using a simple and fast way.
	The Windows Form Application provides a robust and Simple implementation front edge appliance and it becomes a great way to build a form to be used by any kind systems.
Programming Object Oriented can be perceived as a potential method in order to reduce spending in the construction and maintenance of the system proposed, rising up the algorithm to a level near to the reality without losing security of data.
